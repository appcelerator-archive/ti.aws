/*!
 * BedFrame v0.3 by Dawson Toth
 * A framework for exposing RESTful APIs to Appcelerator Titanium Mobile.
 * 
 * This framework is designed for REST APIs with the following characteristics:
 *  1) Contains many different methods, in many different namespaces.
 *  2) Method signatures are all very similar.
 *  
 * You probably don't need this framework if:
 *  1) You only want to expose a couple methods.
 *  
 * To learn more about this framework, or get the latest version, check out:
 *  https://github.com/dawsontoth/BedFrame
 *
 * NO WARRANTY EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
